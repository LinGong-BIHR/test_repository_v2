# Matthew's Repository 

Hello world! :smile: Welcome to my repository. Here I create scripts for tasks as part of a coding course I am enrolled on.

*About me* I am a PhD student based in leeds working with routine secondary care data in order to address anticholinergic burden in secondary care settings. 

In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, cooking and drinking beer :) 
 

here is my [linkedin profile][link_linkedin] if for some reason you are interested and mostly cos I want to practice embedding a link in my readme file.
